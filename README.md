This program basically asks user for input and converts the string which is in hexadecimal form to unsigned decimal integer. While doing so,
it looks for the following cases:
1) if the string is has characters other than '0' to '9' and 'A' to 'F', then it will print an error message
2) if the string is more than 8 characters, then the program won't work
